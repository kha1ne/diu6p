## Project Overview

This repository contains a minimal setup for a React project using TypeScript. The project includes configurations for testing with Jest and Testing Library, as well as Babel plugins for handling modern JavaScript features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional but recommended for package management)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world.git
cd hello-world
yarn install
```

If you prefer npm, you can install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the app at <http://localhost:3000>. The page will automatically reload if you make edits.

### Building the Application

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

The production-ready code will be in the build folder.

## Testing

This project uses Jest and Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

To run the tests, execute:

```bash
yarn test
```

Coverage reports are generated automatically and can be found in the coverage folder after running the tests.
